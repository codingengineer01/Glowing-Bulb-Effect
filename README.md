# Glowing-Bulb-Effect
Glowing Bulb Effect Using HTML And CSS Only
In this program (Glowing Bulb Effect using only HTML & CSS), on the webpage, there is a bulb with a glowing effect and a button also to turn on or off the glowing bulb. This is a pure CSS program that means I used only HTML & CSS to create this glowing effect. To create this effect I used two images of the bulb and swap these images on button click.
